Kubernetes theory

Kubernetes Overview

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. Developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration in the cloud and on-premises environments.

Key Concepts in Kubernetes
Containers and Pods:

Containers: Containers package applications and their dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments.
Pods: In Kubernetes, the smallest deployable unit is a Pod, which can contain one or multiple containers. Pods represent an instance of an application and are scheduled on nodes in the cluster.
Nodes and Clusters:

Node: A node is a physical or virtual machine where Kubernetes deploys Pods. Each node has essential services, such as Kubelet (for communication with the cluster) and container runtime.
Cluster: A cluster is a set of nodes managed by Kubernetes, providing high availability and scalability by distributing applications across nodes.
Services and Networking:

Services: Kubernetes Services expose applications within a cluster or externally. They enable communication between Pods and maintain stable network endpoints, even if individual Pods are added or removed.
Networking: Kubernetes provides network policies to control traffic, facilitating secure and efficient communication between applications.
Controllers:

Controllers monitor the state of the cluster, ensuring that desired states match the actual state. Key controllers include ReplicaSets (maintaining a specified number of Pod replicas), Deployments (managing updates), and StatefulSets (for applications with persistent storage needs).
Storage:

Kubernetes offers several storage options, including Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC), to manage data for stateful applications and databases.
API and Declarative Configuration:

Kubernetes uses a RESTful API for communication and configuration. Resources are managed declaratively with YAML or JSON configuration files, allowing users to specify desired states, which Kubernetes works to achieve.
Kubernetes Benefits
Scalability: With Kubernetes, applications can scale horizontally across thousands of containers.
Self-healing: Kubernetes can automatically restart, reschedule, or replicate Pods to maintain application availability.
Resource Efficiency: Kubernetes optimizes resource usage across the cluster, distributing workloads for maximum efficiency.
Portability: As an open-source tool, Kubernetes is compatible across multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments, making it easy to move applications between environments.
Kubernetes Architecture
The Kubernetes architecture includes Control Plane components, which manage the state of the cluster, and Worker Nodes that run the containerized applications. The Control Plane comprises:

API Server: The main entry point for all RESTful commands.
Scheduler: Assigns Pods to nodes based on available resources.
Controller Manager: Handles various controllers, such as replication and endpoint controllers.
etcd: A key-value store for cluster state data.
Summary
Kubernetes offers a comprehensive framework for managing containerized applications, making it essential in modern DevOps workflows. Its ability to scale, self-heal, and manage resources across multiple environments has led to widespread adoption for cloud-native applications, microservices, and large-scale deployments.
